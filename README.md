# Voting_App

The design and implementation of a blockchain- based electronic voting system. Our focus will be on developing a secure and decentralized network of nodes for electronic voting, equipped with cryptographic and non-repudiation mechanisms. This solution aims to provide end-to-end verification while safeguarding the integrity of the voting process.
